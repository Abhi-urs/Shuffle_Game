# Shuffle_Game

## Overview

The Shuffle Game is a simple interactive Python script where a user tries to guess the index of a hidden '0' in a shuffled list. The list is shuffled each time the script runs, and the user inputs an index to check if it matches the hidden '0'. 

## Features

- **List Shuffling:** The list `[' ', '0', ' ']` is shuffled randomly.
- **User Interaction:** Prompts the user to enter an index to guess the position of the '0'.
- **Feedback:** Provides feedback based on whether the user's guess is correct or not.
- **Display:** Shows the shuffled list after the user makes a guess.
